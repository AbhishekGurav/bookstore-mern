# Welcome to my little MERN Stack project!

I created this project as a little display of what my understanding of MERN Stack looks like. This is imitating a book store where an owner would want to perform CRUD operations over a database of books.


To run the project locally, open up terminal in the project's root directory and do:

`cd frontend && npm run dev` for Frontend

`cd backend && npm run dev` for Backend
